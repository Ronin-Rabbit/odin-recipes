    <h2>Asian Style Pork Chop</h2>
    <p>
      This is using Panko, which is Japanese bread crumbs (really light and
      airy, more so than crackers), and thinly sliced boneless pork chops.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>8 thin cut boneless port chops</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups panko crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, mix together the eggs, milk, garlic, salt and pepper.
        Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place the panko
        crumbs in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse pork chops with water, then dip in the egg mixture. Coat with
        panko crumbs, dip in the egg mixture again, then coat with another layer
        of panko crumbs. Lay coated chops on a plate until the rest are
        finished. If you have time, let them set for about 10 minutes, and the
        coating will set very well. If you wish to freeze the chops, now is the
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the oil is very hot, place pork chops into the pan, and fry for
        about 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.
      </li>
    </ol>
