    <h2>What are Cream Puffs</h2>
    <p>
      Cream puffs, or profiteroles, are French choux pastry balls filled with
      cream. Choux pastry is made without leavening agents — instead, it relies
      on a high moisture content to create steam and puff the pastry during
      baking.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (3.5 ounce) packages instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1/2cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix together vanilla instant pudding mix, cream and milk. Cover and
        refrigerate to set.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, bring water and butter to a rolling boil. Stir in flour
        and salt until the mixture forms a ball. Transfer the dough to a large
        mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon or stand mixer, beat in the eggs one
        at a time, mixing well after each. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto an
        ungreased baking sheet, spacing them a couple of inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown.
        Centers should be dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the shells are cool, either split and fill them with the pudding
        mixture, or use a pastry bag to pipe the pudding into the shells.
      </li>
    </ol>
